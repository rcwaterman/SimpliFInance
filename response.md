- **Current Market Price**: $118.22

### Step 9: Calculate Valuation Percentage

Let's calculate how overvalued or undervalued Nvidia stock is by comparing the intrinsic value with the current market price.

\[ \text{Valuation Percentage} = \frac{\text{Intrinsic Value} - \text{Current Market Price}}{\text{Intrinsic Value}} \]

\[ \text{Valuation Percentage} = \frac{464.8 - 118.22}{464.8} \]

\[ \text{Valuation Percentage} = \frac{346.58}{464.8} \]

\[ \text{Valuation Percentage} = 0.7455 \text{ or } 74.55\% \]

Nvidia stock appears to be **undervalued** by approximately **74.55%** based on the DCF analysis. The intrinsic value per share is $464.8, while the current market price is $118.22.
